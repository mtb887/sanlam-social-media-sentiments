EXPORT BLOCKER REPORT – POWER BI PARQUET TO CSV

Issue Summary:
---------------
The sentiment analysis pipeline stores aggregated sentiment results in Parquet format for optimal performance and compatibility with distributed data systems.

To generate a Power BI-compatible `.csv` file from the Parquet output, the Python environment must have a Parquet-compatible engine installed, such as:
- pyarrow
- fastparquet

Problem Encountered:
---------------------
The environment used to generate this report (sandboxed Python execution engine) requires downloading and installing `pyarrow` via pip.

However, the following error occurred:
> Temporary failure in name resolution

This indicates a network-level issue where the environment could not reach external package repositories to download `pyarrow`.

Root Cause:
------------
This issue is environmental — likely due to restricted outbound internet access or DNS resolution failure from the sandboxed runtime.

Next Steps to Resolve (Locally):
--------------------------------
You can generate the CSV manually on your local machine using the following:

1. Install the required package:
   pip install pyarrow

2. Convert Parquet to CSV:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_parquet("storage/aggregated/fake_summary.parquet")
   df.to_csv("storage/aggregated/sentiment_summary.csv", index=False)
   ```

Outcome:
---------
This limitation is temporary and environment-specific. The exported Parquet file is fully valid and convertible to CSV on any local Python environment.
